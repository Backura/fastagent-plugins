An open-source collection of AI agents and rules designed to help developers and cloud engineers write standard and maintainable code, **FASTER** ⚡

**Tags:** #cursor #claude $subagents #codex #windsurf #agents.md #kiro #copilot

## 💡 What is this?

[Agents and Rules](https://github.com/armanzeroeight/agents-rules) is a curated set of best practices, standards, and guidelines for various programming languages and tools. Think of it as your AI coding companion's knowledge base – helping you follow industry standards and write clean, maintainable code.

## 🎯 Who is this for?

- Developers who want to follow best practices
- Cloud engineers and Platform engineers
- Teams looking to standardize their coding practices
- AI agents that help write code (like Kiro, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

## ✨ Features

- **rule sets** covering a broad spectrum of programming languages and services.
- **Specialized agents** (coming soon) for different development workflows.
- **AI-optimized** format for seamless integration with coding assistants.
- **Community-driven** with contributions from developers worldwide.

## 📚 Available Rules

| Name | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| [Terraform Rules](rules/terraform.md) | Infrastructure as Code | Write clean, secure, and maintainable IaC |

More rules and languages coming soon! 🎉

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We'd love your help making this collection even better! Here's how:

1. **Create a PR** with what you think is a good practice or add a new language/agent
2. **Follow the template** – check out existing files like [terraform.md](rules/terraform.md) to see the structure
3. **Add an icon** – Drop an SVG logo of the programming language/tool in the `rules/icons/` directory
   - [Logosear.ch](https://logosear.ch/) has tons of high-quality logos you can use
4. **Keep it simple** – Write in a friendly, straightforward tone. Use emojis when they fit! ✨

### Template Structure

Each rule file should include:
- **Frontmatter** with metadata (name, description, category, icon, version, globs)
- **Clear examples** showing good vs bad practices
- **Practical code snippets** that developers can actually use
- **Organized sections** covering different aspects of the language/tool

## 📖 Using These Rules

These rules are designed to be consumed by AI coding assistants, but they're also great references for human developers. You can:

- Use them as steering files in your AI IDE
- Reference them during code reviews
- Share them with your team as coding standards
- Contribute improvements based on your experience

## 🌟 Why [Agents & Rules](https://github.com/armanzeroeight/agents-rules)?

Because writing good code shouldn't be hard. With the right guidelines and AI assistance, you can focus on solving problems instead of remembering syntax and best practices.
